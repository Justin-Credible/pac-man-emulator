# Pac-Man Emulator

An emulator for the [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) CPU and hardware specific to the 1980 arcade game: Pac-Man.

This is based on the Intel 8080 CPU core from my [Space Invaders emulator](https://github.com/Justin-Credible/space-invaders-emulator).

ðŸš§ Work in progress! ðŸš§
